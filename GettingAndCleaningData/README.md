# GettingAndCleaningData
This repository demonstrates the steps of completing the project of getting and cleaning data which is available in Coursera.
You should creat a R.script does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# Files
Codebook.md describes the meaning of the variables and how to use them.
run_analysis.R performs the 5 steps mentioned before, just take a try and it will show you how the analysis perform.
