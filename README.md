# Statistical-Inference-Course-Project
In this project we will investigate the exponential distribution and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem.  
The mean and the standard deviation of the exponential distribution is 1/lambda.  
The analysis set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. And we will look into the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials over 1,000 simulations.
